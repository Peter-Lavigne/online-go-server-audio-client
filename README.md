# Online Go Server Audio Client

A client for the [Online Go Server](https://online-go.com) that uses voice input as an interface. I use this to play in my living room while sitting on the couch.

The app is live at [ogs-voice-client.surge.sh](https://ogs-voice-client.surge.sh).

You must be signed into an Online Go Server account to use this app.
